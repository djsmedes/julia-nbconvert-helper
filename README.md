This repo exists to address a few challenges.

Using Julia in a Jupyter notebook is great, but if you want to convert that notebook into a PDF, there is no good way to do it. Converting to HTML and then converting that to a PDF using a browser's "print to PDF" function results in the code boxes getting cut off. Converting with `jupyter nbconvert` causes the unicode characters in your Julia code, like â‰¤, to simply disappear. One of the cool features of Julia is the unicode support - I don't want to give that up!

It turns out you just need the interim LaTeX that gets generated by `jupyter nbconvert` to set a monospaced font that actually has unicode support, instead of whatever dumb non-unicode-supporting font they do use. This can be achieved by running:

```shell
jupyter nbconvert your.ipynb --to latex
```

Then manually going into the generated LaTeX file and adding:

```latex
    \setmonofont{DejaVu Sans Mono}
```

Then running that `.tex` file through `xelatex`.

There's got to be a better way!

Well, in theory there is - you should be able to define a custom template for nbconvert so that you include the monospaced font override every time it generates some LaTeX, including the interim stage on its way to being a PDF.

However, the official documentation for nbconvert (https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customizing.html) does not explain how to properly do this! They give an example, but it uses standard Jinja2 stuff.

THE LATEX TEMPLATES USE WEIRD NONSTANDARD CHARACTERS.

Check out the file in this repo, mono_unicode.tex.j2, or any of the files in the jupyter/nbconvert repo that end in .tex.j2.

Anyway, the final problem worth solving is not wanting a local LaTeX install, because every time I try to do that, it always seems like it's putting all sorts of crap all over my computer that I don't want. My solution there is to use Docker.

The result is a Dockerfile with supporting template override files which you can use to build a Docker image locally and then run Julia .ipynb files through it to produce PDFs that actually have your Unicode characters.

# Build Docker image

```shell
docker build -t texlive-nbconvert .
```

# Run a Jupyter notebook through it

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" texlive-nbconvert jupyter nbconvert your.ipynb --to pdf --template mono_unicode
```
